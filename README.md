started learning spring framework 

1. first start with my learning journey with JSP and Servlets (1-Month Summary)

In just one month, I embarked on a journey to learn JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets, diving into Java-based web development. Here's a summary of what I covered ..

I learned that Servlets are Java classes used to handle HTTP requests and responses, while JSPs are used to generate dynamic content for web pages.
I quickly learned how to create simple Servlets to handle HTTP requests. By setting up a basic servlet and deploying it to a Tomcat server, I was able to grasp the request-response model.

Building an MVC Web Application--
I applied my knowledge by creating a small web application using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. This helped me understand how Servlets handle the controller logic and how JSPs are used for the view
Configuration in web.xml--
One of the important aspects I learned was how to configure Servlets and JSPs in the web.xml deployment descriptor file.

then after completing this i created some project using this concept e.g handling request from client side , MVC project for registration and seamlessly login pages etc

2. started learnig spring core/jdbc/hibernate/orm/mvc comcepts
