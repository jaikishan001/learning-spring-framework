# learning-spring-framework
started learning spring framework 

1. first start with my learning journey with JSP and Servlets (1-Month Summary)

In just one month, I embarked on a journey to learn JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets, diving into Java-based web development. Here's a summary of what I covered ..

I learned that Servlets are Java classes used to handle HTTP requests and responses, while JSPs are used to generate dynamic content for web pages.
I quickly learned how to create simple Servlets to handle HTTP requests. By setting up a basic servlet and deploying it to a Tomcat server, I was able to grasp the request-response model.

Building an MVC Web Application--
I applied my knowledge by creating a small web application using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. This helped me understand how Servlets handle the controller logic and how JSPs are used for the view
Configuration in web.xml--
One of the important aspects I learned was how to configure Servlets and JSPs in the web.xml deployment descriptor file.

then after completing this i created some project using this concept e.g handling request from client side , MVC project for registration and seamlessly login pages etc

2. started learnig spring core/jdbc/hibernate/orm/mvc comcepts

Once I became comfortable with JSP and Servlets, I shifted to learning Spring Core. I focused on concepts like Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI), which are fundamental to building loosely coupled, maintainable applications. I learned how Spring’s ApplicationContext and BeanFactory work to manage beans and their lifecycles

I moved on to learning Spring JDBC to simplify database interactions. This allowed me to work with relational databases without dealing with much boilerplate code. I also delved into Spring ORM to integrate Hibernate and manage database operations in a more object-oriented way

Finally, I explored Spring MVC, a powerful framework for building web applications with a clean MVC architecture. I learned how Spring MVC controllers handle HTTP requests, how to return views from controllers, and how to bind form data to Java objects. I also worked with ViewResolvers, model attributes, and validation to make the application more user-friendly.

I became proficient in configuring Spring beans through both XML-based configuration and Java-based configuration (using annotations like @Configuration and @Bean). I also worked with the web.xml file to map Spring DispatcherServlet and integrate Spring with web applications.

Challenges and Problem-Solvin---
As I delved into Spring and Hibernate, I faced several challenges, particularly with dependency injection, transaction management, and understanding the different layers of Spring applications. Debugging issues related to Hibernate configurations, session management.


---I’m now excited to continue expanding my knowledge, especially with Spring Boot, Spring Security, and more advanced Hibernate techniques.
