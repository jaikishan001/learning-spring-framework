1--First start with my learning journey with JSP and Servlets (1-Month Summary)
In just one month, I embarked on a journey to learn JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets, diving into Java-based web development. Here's a summary of what I covered.

By this, I understood that Servlets are Java classes that are used to handle HTTP requests and responses. JSPs are used for dynamically generating content for web pages. 

I easily learned how to create a simple Servlet to handle HTTP requests. I can comprehend the request-response model by running a simple servlet against a Tomcat server.

Building an MVC Web Application-- 
I had a chance to use my learning to build a small web application using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. This helped me understand how the controller logic gets handled by the Servlets and how the views are done in JSPs. 

Configuration in web.xml-- Another important part of what I learned was to configure Servlets and JSPs in the web.xml deployment descriptor file.

then after completing this i created some project using this concept e.g handling request from client side, MVC project for registration and seamlessly login pages etc

started learnig spring core/jdbc/hibernate/orm/mvc comcepts

As I got comfortable with JSP and Servlets, I started moving to Spring Core. Here I concentrated on understanding Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI), concepts which are vital in developing loosely coupled, maintainable applications. 

I learned about how Spring's ApplicationContext and BeanFactory work toward the management of beans and their lifecycles.

I began learning Spring JDBC to make database interactions easier. That way, I was able to work with relational databases without much boilerplate code. 
I found out and learned Spring ORM, which integrated Hibernate for more object-oriented ways of managing database operations.

Finally, I explored the application of Spring MVC-a very powerful framework for building web applications with clean MVC architecture.
I learned how Spring MVC controllers handle HTTP requests, how to return views from controllers, how to bind form data to Java objects, and even how to handle ViewResolvers, model attributes, and validation in order to make the application user-friendly.

The configuration of Spring beans was learned on both XML-based configuration and Java-based configuration, with the help of annotations like @Configuration and @Bean. In addition, for mapping the web.xml file, Spring DispatcherServlet was used to integrate Spring with web applications.

Challenges and Problem-Solving---

As I dived into Spring and Hibernate, I faced several challenges, especially with dependency injection, transaction management, and understanding the different layers of Spring applications. Debugging issues related to Hibernate configurations, session management.

---I'm now excited to continue expanding my knowledge, especially with Spring Boot, Spring Security, and more advanced Hibernate techniques.
